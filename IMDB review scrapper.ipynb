       "'This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red\\'s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don\\'t listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.'"

       "'Not gonna lie, the plot progression resembles Good Time a lot more than I could anticipate, but I was also engaged the whole time, thanks to a very solid, believable showing from Vanessa Kirby. Her eyes do a lot of the talking in certain scenes, and I would never complain about the number of back shots we get of hers (..yeah, she\\'s got a great BACK..uff!). For director Benjamin Caron, this is a slightly better effort than Sharper, more so because the events can be tied to real middle-class happenings.I liked the conversations that the central characters keep having, showcasing sufficient detail without resorting to gimmicks like flashbacks or cutaways. Jennifer Jason Leigh, Zack Gottsagen, and Stephan James offer good support to Kirby, balancing out the plot absurdities with some level of grounded stability. I\\'ll award this 3 stars, as this story was never meant to give you the quintessential happy ending, and it doesn\\'t. It just concludes at a detour, and we\\'re left to write the rest of the story ourselves. Maybe.. just maybe, it would\\'ve helped knowing Kirby\\'s character a bit more BEFORE we jumped into the \"timebound thriller\" part of the plot.'"
